    46) need to explain pytest-asyncio
    47) need to figure out how to run tests with uvloop
    48) need deep learning pytest

Current tasks:
    1) refresh token in cookies need to change (done)
    2) add validate email regexp (done)
        - howto python regexp (done)
    3) learn logging and implement in backend (done)
        - write toml file with logging config (done)
	- write many toml files for backend configuration (done)
	- think about optimizations for logging (done)
	- how to communicate with journald if backend is systemd unit - just write in stderr or stdout (done)
	- need custom formaters or filters for adding additional info! - not required (done)
	- need custom handler for SMTP mail_admin with asyncio (deffered)
	- log format for aiohttp.access (done)
	- read complete logging.config documentation (done)
	- need to add log.info and log.debug into code maybe with comments? (done)
    4) add comments in code (done)
    5) put in orded knowledge base (done)
    6) need to do app.config_dict['...'] (done)
    7) learn pytest (done)
    8) implement tests for backend
        - simple script in makefile with create db and drop db
	- figure out how to work with logging
	- figure out how write test without pytest-aiohttp
	- creating and destroying db it is not a task for backend!
    9) put in order knowledge base
        - just need linux to put in order
