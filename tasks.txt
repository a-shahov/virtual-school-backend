        - write toml file with logging config (done)
	- write many toml files for backend configuration (done)
	- think about optimizations for logging (done)
	- how to communicate with journald if backend is systemd unit - just write in stderr or stdout (done)
	- need custom formaters or filters for adding additional info! - not required (done)
